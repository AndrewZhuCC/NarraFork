/**
 * Authorization for control actions one narrator takes on another (Stop, a Send
 * interrupt, archive/unarchive).
 *
 * Control is a separate grant from reachability: being able to message, subscribe to
 * or share a fork source with a session confers no control. The only source of
 * control is the target's registered `controller` grant (see `lib/runtime-source.ts`),
 * narrowed by the caller's current capability ceiling and the current human ACL.
 *
 * Human requests over HTTP never come through here; they keep the plain write ACL.
